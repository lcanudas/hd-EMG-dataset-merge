## [1] High-density Surface and Intramuscular EMG Data from the Tibialis Anterior During Dynamic Contractions: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02114-1
“High spatiotemporal resolution representation of the motor control system in dynamic, but controlled, conditions”
Subjects:
Seven between the ages of 18 and 45
Experimental procedure:
Tibialis anterior (intramuscular and surface electromyography) and ankle joint dynamics
HD-EMG instrumentation -> maximal isometric contractions -> fw-EMG instrumentation -> submaximal contractions (isometric RAH, isometric sinusoidal, isotonic RAH and isokinetic) -> fw-EMG removal -> maximal isokinetic contractions -> HD-EMG removal
Submaximal: 10, 25 and 50% of maximum voluntary isometric contraction
Experimental set-up:
Biodex isokinetic dynamometer for ankle dorsiflexion (Biodex System 4 Pro – software: Research Toolkit RTK)
HD-EMG: 126 channels; 9 x 14 grid with center-center distance of 4 mm; electrodes were round (1.95 mm in diameter) of copper body coated with pure silver; (BioSemi)
Data acquisition and synchronization:
Data were collected with Micro1401-3 data acquisition system with Spike2 version 9.0 data acquisition software
Sampled at 2048 Hz with BioSemi ActiveTwo biopotential amplifier and recorded by ActiView software
“For data alignment between the Micro 1401-3 and Biosemi data acquisition systems, a 1 V double square wave synch pulse was output from the Micro1401-3 system to the Biosemi Analog Input Box.”

## [5] Surface EMG-Based Inter-Session Gesture Recognition Enhanced by Deep Domain Adaptation: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/3/458
“Benchmark database of HD-sEMG recordings of hand gestures” “...we describe the CapgMyo database, which includes HD-sEMG data for 128 channels acquired from 23 intact subjects by using our newly developed acquisition device”
O banco de dados CapgMyo tem 3 sub-bancos: DB-a — 8 isometric and isotonic gestures from 18/23 —, DB-b — from 10/23 —, DB-c — 12 basic movements of the fingers from 10/23
Comparou com NinaPro, CSL-HDEMG e CapgMyo dataset como referência
Subjects:
Twenty three between the ages of 23 to 26
Procedure:
Extensor digitorum communis muscle at the height of the radio-humeral joint
Set up:
Non-invasive wearable device with 8 acquisition modules
Each module: 8 x 2 grid; each electrode with 3 mm diameter; inter-electrode distance of 7.5 mm horizontally and 10.05 mm vertically
Data acquisition:
Sampling rate of 2048 Hz
Power-line interference was removed from the sEMG signals by using a band-stop filter (45-55 Hz, second-order Butterworth)
